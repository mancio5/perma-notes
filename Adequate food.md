# Adequate food
A chicken left in the wild will pick:
1.  high protein - insect and animals that are slow to escape
2.  energy-packed seeds hanging on the plants
2.  high nutritious clover and legumes
3.  tender shoots of grasses
4.  after the soil has been left bare, they start scratching exposing the roots of the plants digging for more insects and worms.

## Commercial feed
**Starter:** for chicks until 5-6 weeks old. Don't feed any of the other feeds.
**Grower:** 5 weeks to 5 months when they first laying their eggs.
**Layer**: they until the end of their life

## Calcium
Provide this supplement especially when they are laying eggs.

- Crushed egg shells
- oyster shell

## Grits
Tiny rocks that chickens eat and that they go straight in their stomach and they use to break up food.

Get them from a creek, it's free and comes with a lot of minerals.

## Feeders
Provide plenty of feeders so they have no need to fight for food.
The feeders are better to hang up at proper height so they stay clean and no food is scattered around.

## Amount of food
Eating too much lower the egg production.

**Ration their food**.
Start decreasing their grains and increase live food.

**Are they eating enough?**
- Reduce their food.
- Keep track by the week of the amount of food given compared with the egg production. 
- If the production doesn't decrease then cut off 10% each week until it does.
- When you notice a difference go back to previous level.

To check if they have enough: get them at night and feel around their neck, where they store some of the food, and feel if they have enough in there.

## Move them on new pasture
see [moving systems](#moving-systems)

# What not to feed them
- **Raw potato peeels**: peels, especially when they turn green contain the alkaloid solanine, which is toxic.
- **Garlic and onions**: these are not toxic but may impart a flavor to the eggs.
- **Avocado skins and pits**: avocado contain person, a fungicide toxic to chickens
- **spoiled or rooten food**: these may contain toxins.
- **Chocolate**: this contains theobromine, which may be toxic to chickens.
- **Raw meat**: feeding raw meat may lead to cannibalism.

# Different feeds

## Soil building plants
- confrey, nitrogen fixing plant, only plant with b12 
- stinging neetle

## Animals
Little mice, or other animals that you can't rid of. Capture and feed to the chicken.

## Midget bucket
Sustain a bucket in the air, drill 3/8 in. holes in the bottom.
Put the carcass of animal in there.
Flies will come into the holes and lay their eggs.
Midget will crawl out of the holes and chicken will wait them.

## Cover crop
When you finish with a bed or you need to remove the cover crop let the chickens in. Will eat the crop and till the ground.

## Weeds
Grass, Dandelion, stinging nettle etc. You cut it or let the chicken go and eat them.
20% of their diet can be on grass.

## Garden waste
All the brown leaves or what has been ruined by bugs. Left over crops.

## Potatoes
Boiled potatoes.

## Winter squash
They love flesh and seeds.

## Forage crops
Grow forage like:

- white clover
- buckwheat
- brown top millet
- bean corn
- sunflower
- amaranth
- alpha alpha, etc.

## Nuts
Crushed nuts found in the wild.

## Fruit trees
Excess fruits can go to the chickens.
You can run the chicken in the orchard after the fruits have fallen (doing this will sanitize the orchard from bugs).

## Garden pets
Find garden bugs knock them in a bucket of water (so they can't fly away) and feed to the chickens.

## Fermented feed
If you need to feed them with grain why not ferment it? It will boost their immune system especially when they are chicks.

- put couple of days of food in a bucket
- cover with water
- leave it for a 3 days

it should smell sour not moldy

## Duckweed
It reproduce by itself.

## Soldier flies
Biopod - portapod to get the larvas.
In their adult life (1 day) their only purpose is to mate and lay eggs. They will look for rotting vegetables to lay eggs. The larva will grow eating the vegetables and will try to crawl out of the bin.

## Sprout all grain
Increase the protein digestibility up to 30%.

## Food scraps & compost

## Eggs
If you have extra eggs, just crush them or cook them.

## Feathers
It's full of proteins. If they need it they will eat otherwise it will compost there.

 






## Use compost to feed chicken
