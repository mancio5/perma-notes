# Protection
From predators

## Close the chickens at night
Usually predators strike at night. Closing the coop door after the chickens retreat.
The highest number of looses happen because we forget to close the chicken at night or leaving them out till too late.

## Prevent digging
To improve the safety of nonelectric fencing, fold 1-foot-strip of fencing toward the interior of the pen and bury or use sod staples to secure the fencing to the ground.

## Holes smaller than 2.5 cm
Not spaces in the coop bigger than 2.5cm.

## Don't leave chicks out
Chicks have an high risk of aerial attacks. Don't leave them out  without a net protection.

## Protected area
Provide a place where they can hide or protect from other animals.

## Prevent them from flying out
Can clip one their wings on ONE SIDE so they can't fly out anymore.

## Snakes
Some snakes can come in a take the eggs. Avoid leaving the eggs for too long or move your coop more often.

## Guardian animals
Dogs, roosters, but better geese. Geese they eat a lot of grass and same food of the chickens.

## Electric Fencing
Closing the chicken in the coop at night + fencing the area around offer a double protection. 

An electrified fence **can't be cover so arial attacks** from hawks or other animals are possible. In this case is better to have shrubs, trees or a shelter to offer an easy escape in case of danger.

**Not clean ground can make the circuit go down.**
If grasses touch the fence this can lower the electricity.
