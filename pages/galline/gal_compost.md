Couple of months before I want to plant, cage chickens with electric fence and feed them 100% on compost.

- 1 cubic meter of vegetables scraps
- 35kg of chicken manure

For 25m2 of garden preparation = 3 cubic meter of compost.

### week 1
- mix the compost material (leaves and manure) in the pallet cube
- wet it
- leaving to warm up for a week
- let chicken go over the pile and manure on top
