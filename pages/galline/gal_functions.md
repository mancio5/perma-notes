Chicken can be used to prepare a new garden:

- removing all insects
- removing all vegetation
- removing seeds
- exposing the bare soil for planting
- fertilizing the area
 

## Insect and weeds control
Chickens can be left briefly in the vegetable garden allowing them to hunt for insects and bugs.

## Fertilizing - Nitrogen Source
Each chicken can poop 8 pounds of manure a month. Left in a place they will manure and fertilize the space.
1 chicken can fertilize 4.5m2 feet in a month.

## Expose soil and tilling
The mow the grass and when they have finished with the vegetation they start scratching the soil digging for more insects and worm, moving the soil.

## Spreading
Leave the compost or the material that we want to spread in the area, chicken will do that for us. They won't spread completely but they will do 70% of the work.

## Garbage disposal
They will eat all the food scraps.

## Insect control
Their first food choice are bugs. You can let them go in the garden looking for bugs. 
If they stay for too long they might start eating the produces.

## Sanitize the orchard
Don't keep the chicken there all time because the orchard doesn't need that much nitrogen but you can run them there in spring and autumn.
- spring: will eat insects and larvas
- fall: will eat all the bugs that are in the fallen fruits and break the pests cycle.
