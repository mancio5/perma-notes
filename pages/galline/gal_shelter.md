## Costs
cost: 0 - ~1000

## Needs
- Protection from the elements
- protection from predators
- adequate sunlight
- space for dust box
- space to lay eggs

## Shelter from the rain and sun
At least 75% of the top covered from rain and sun.
If the chicken don't have enough shade they will stay in the coop instead of foraging, eating therefore only commercial feed.

## Spacing
The housing should be design to to house chickens, not humans so the dimension can be shrink to chicken size becoming smaller and cheaper.

**Pen**
They stay there all day.
3-5sq feet = 0.46m2 = ~70x70cm i
4m2 of chicken tractor = 8-9 galline.

**Night Housing** 
Only housing at night 
1sq feet = 0.09m2 = 30 x 30cm 

## Air ventilation
Keep air flow and dust and smell out also during the winter.

## Netting
No any gap bigger than 2.5cm to keep predators away.

## Deep bedding
If they stay in the same space they need a deep bedding to capture the manure and ammonia.

## Trespoli
In nature they would stay high up to protect from predators.
Stay up on these to sleep at night make them feel safer.
They like to stay close to each other during the winter.

## Nest boxes
- Place in the deepest and darkest area
- away from busy area like waterers or feeders
- high up or with the top covered so other chickens can manure on top
- no bigger than 30x30cm so only one hen can stay there
- it's preferable not to use wheat straw because frustrate the hens and they scratch and break the eggs. Use pine straw. They can easily adjust it
