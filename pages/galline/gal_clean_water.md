## How much water
daily: 0.5 lt = 4 adults.

When chickens don’t have enough water they become stressed and egg production decline for same time.

## Keep water clean
- Clean the waterer every day
- keep the waterer off the ground

(this offers also some shade and protection from flying predators)

## Keep the water cool
During warm season:

- put cool water
- put in shade

## Keep the water from freezing
- put waterers inside the house during the night
- water heater
- use glass as greenhouse
