## Collecting the eggs
- wait at least 10 days after separation
- get 8-12 eggs in max 4 days (use always the newest)
- see if you have a breeding hen
- if you have it put the eggs under her
- if not discard the eggs older than 4 days

## Set up the brooder
- separated from the other chickens
- deep bedding
- breeding box

- feed + water(they don't eat or drink much during this time)
- dark place

## Test the hen
- put fake eggs in the pen to see if one the hen is breedy 
- the hen that stays on the eggs at night when all the others are on the trespoli might be ready

## Put her in the brooder
- separate her at night when she can't see much
- put her in the breeding box with the fake eggs for 24h to check if she will stay on the eggs until the hatching
- if she tries to come out put the opening over a wall

- come back in after 6 hours to check if she is quiter
- if she is ready we replace the fake eggs with the fertilized one
