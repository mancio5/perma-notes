## Adequate food
A chicken left in the wild will pick:
1.  high protein - insect and animals that are slow to escape
2.  energy-packed seeds hanging on the plants
2.  high nutritious clover and legumes
3.  tender shoots of grasses
4.  after the soil has been left bare, they start scratching exposing the roots of the plants digging for more insects and worms.

### Commercial feed
**Starter:** for chicks until 5-6 weeks old. Don't feed any of the other feeds.
**Grower:** 5 weeks to 5 months when they first laying their eggs.
**Layer**: they until the end of their life

### Calcium
Provide this supplement especially when they are laying eggs.

- Crushed egg shells
- oyster shell

### Grits
Tiny rocks that chickens eat and that they go straight in their stomach and they use to break up food.

Get them from a creek, it's free and comes with a lot of minerals.

### Feeders
Provide plenty of feeders so they have no need to fight for food.
The feeders are better to hang up at proper height so they stay clean and no food is scattered around.

### Amount of food
Eating too much lower the egg production.

**Ration their food**.
Start decreasing their grains and increase live food.

**Are they eating enough?**
- Reduce their food.
- Keep track by the week of the amount of food given compared with the egg production. 
- If the production doesn't decrease then cut off 10% each week until it does.
- When you notice a difference go back to previous level.

To check if they have enough: get them at night and feel around their neck, where they store some of the food, and feel if they have enough in there.

### Move them on new pasture
see [moving systems](#moving-systems)

## What not to feed them
- **Raw potato peeels**: peels, especially when they turn green contain the alkaloid solanine, which is toxic.
- **Garlic and onions**: these are not toxic but may impart a flavor to the eggs.
- **Avocado skins and pits**: avocado contain person, a fungicide toxic to chickens
- **spoiled or rooten food**: these may contain toxins.
- **Chocolate**: this contains theobromine, which may be toxic to chickens.
- **Raw meat**: feeding raw meat may lead to cannibalism.
