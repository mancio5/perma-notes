## Free Roaming
Free roaming chicken are good only on mature and established systems. Where large trees shade out the grasses and leave a layer of mulch for the birds to rummage through.
Problems with this approach are:

- chickens make a mess of mulched areas
- destroy raised beds
- eat any seeds planted
- poop, roost and scatter eggs everywhere
-  are easy meal for predators

## Moving systems
By confining chickens with a fencing or a movable coop, you force the chickens into a successional pattern that either benefits or destroy the landscape.

**To keep the pasture alive**, move the pastured poultry often.
If the chickens are frequently rotated onto fresh new growth, the pasture sill provide a maximum amount of feed and protein.
In contrast, if the chickens stay in the same pen for too long, they begin to deplete the leaves available to supply the plant with energy for regrowth. The plant must then use energy stored in the root system, and the whole plant is weakened as a result. 
Move them in when the grass 15-20cm and move them out with is about 7cm.

On the contrary **overgrazing, clean and area and prepare for seeding** the chicken can till and forage till the grass are weak.

## Fencing
A movable or stable coop house the chicken that stay there at night but out foraging inside a fence during the day.
The fence can be movable as well and electrified.
