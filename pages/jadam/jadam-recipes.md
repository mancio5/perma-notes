## Jadam Indigenous Microorganisms solution (JMS)


## Soil foundation Work
- JMS 500L from 0.1ha to 3.5ha
- Minerals - sea salt 0.5 kg per 0.1ha
- Minerals - phyllite solution 20l per 0.1 ha
- Crop Residue or Jadam Liquid Fertilizer - GC-JLF diluted 100 times

**For areas smaller than 0.08 ac, do not add sea salt because they are added when making JMS**


## Jadam JMS + Sea Salt
Mixing microorganisms from leaf mold with sea water take all the diversity Earth has to offer: from the sea and the land.

Note that since sea water is around 3% salt and the body fluid of plants is around 1%, you must mix the sea water with 30 to 100 times more plain water.
This is to prevent salt damage to plants and accumulation of Na and Cl in soil.

Mix sea salt with JMS and apply 3-4 times a month.
Using sea water not only supplements nutrients leaching the soil but also improve sweetness, coloring, storing period and produce value.
Sea water has plenty of S, Mg, Ca, K, B, P, I which are beneficial for plant growth.

**Do not sprinkle salt directly onto soil or spray undiluted sea water!**

If you cannot obtain sea water, then sa salt can be used. 
20 lt of sea water is equal around 500gr of salt.

## Phyllite solution
Add fine-powdered [phyllite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phyllite) (fillade [it]) as mineral supplement. 
This rock contains almost all inorganic nutrients required by plants.

- 60kg of phyllite powder
- 500l of water
- stir and let it settle for few hours 
- scoop out the upper water for use.
- refill the water when you need.
- use throughout the year

if phyllite is not available use other rock powders.
