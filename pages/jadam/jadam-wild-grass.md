## Co-existing with wild grass
If we do not succeed in transforming our relationship with wild grass into a symbiotic one, farming will be forever pain.

## When there is wild grass on the soil, it will be much moister, more fertile and have less disease

## Cover crop prevents "early flowering"
With bare soil the temperature in spring rises much faster.
The roots of the trees think that summer is coming and flower in hurry.
This result in poor quality pollen with leads to poor pollination.

**In october** before the fruit trees drop their leaves sow grass seeds in the field. Grass will sprout before the leaves fall, so that once the leaves fall, they will be caught in between grass.
The leaves are the essence of all nutrients, sucked up from deep inside the soil by trees for one year.
**With a grass you can trap these nutrients**.

The grass also protect the soil from the direct sunlight, keeping the soil warm but not hot. This leads to a smooth rise in temperature as the season progresses

## Cover crop suppresses soil-overheating in summer
When temperatura reaches 40*C most crop roots stop to function.
Black plastic mulch in the early stages of the season

- are effettive to keep the weeds out
- keep the soil warm
- hold the moisture and nutrients

When the hot season begins, the plastic sheet chokes the roots and drives the plants to ill health. 

**Temperature management is the key to success in summer farming**
To keep the temperature preferred by the crops, you have to use cover crop.

## Cover crop mitigates soil compaction and increase mineral content
- Grow a few different kinds of grass in your orchard
- Cut them down two or three times from spring to autumn
- They will turn in excellent fertilizer.

- Wild grass with vigorous growth will stretch roots deep into the earth (more than 1.5 the above ground height).
- They pull minerals from deep down making it available for other crops.

Controlling weeds might require more labor but there a lot of benefits from symbiosis.
