## Bad fertilizer
Bad fertilizer is equivalent to bad food.

### Poisonous and chemical
Compost that come from animal manure often contain antibiotics.

### Unbalanced ratio between organic and inorganic nutrients.
Humans are used to eat fruits only and discarding the skin. We take the kernel but not the husk.

This harmless looking act is a threat for human health.
The peel (husk) is full of inorganic nutrients and vitamins.

In farming we are applying too much outer-part fertilizer.

The results is an unbalance between organic and inorganic nutrients.

## Soil compaction
On covered soil, acid rains will sink deep in the ground where microorganisms will act on the pollutants and purify the water.

On modern agriculture, the operation of heavy vehicles compress the soil.

### Salt accumulation 
When the rain falls, water is trapped in this compacted soil layer. It does not flow down but rather stagnates at a short depth below the surface, slowly evaporating and leaving the salt behind.

### Heavy metals

When acid rain evaporates, it leaves behind pollutants and heavy metals in the soil.

**We have to get rid of the compacted soil layer.**

### Poor air, water and nutrients circulation

### A solution for this? 
[Eliminate the compaction layer]()
Unless you eliminate this layer, soil salinity will always be a problem and farming will be more difficult.

## Monoculture Farming
Growing one type of plant on the same land repeatedly.

### Nutrients depletion
**will use always the same nutrients ending up depleting the soil of those nutrients.**

The solution would appear to be **rotating** the culture, but there is not such thing in the wild. In the wild a seed can fall in the place for hundreds of year, so why this happen without creating any disorder?

*In nature leaves, branches, roots, fruits etc fall on the ground and are disintegrated by the microbes and are returned to the soil. When they fall back on the soil the minerals previously held are released. **They have moved but not removed** *

## Removing crop residues - leaching of minerals
Whereas "natural leaching of minerals" is the deprivation go nutrients from the soil mainly because the fruits are taken, forced leaching refers to the process where nutrients are deprived due the practice of removing crop residues.
In human farming the crops residue, supposedly carrying diseases, are removed from the soil. 

[**They are instead the perfect source of nutrients or fertilizer.**](jadam-nature-does-it.html/#fertilizer)

Current agricultural practices leaves the soil deprived of nutrients and call for more market-brought fertilizers and pesticides.

Organic nutrients come from the sun, air and water that are infinite resources. However is not the same for inorganic nutrients. **Minerals are finite resources** and what is taken out is taken out.



### Disease

Increasing the diversity of microorganisms in the soil will stop disease-causing organisms to gain dominance.
