## Problems with monoculture farming

### Monoculture
Growing one type of plant on the same land repeatedly, will use always the same nutrients ending up depleting the soil of those nutrients.

The solution would appear to be **rotating** the culture, but there is not such thing in the wild. In the wild a seed can fall in the place for hundreds of year, so why this happen without creating any disorder?

*In nature leaves, branches, roots, fruits etc fall on the ground and are disintegrated by the microbes and are returned to the soil. When they fall back on the soil the minerals previously held are released. **They have moved but not removed** *

In human farming the crops residue, soupposenly carring diseases, are removed from the soil. **They are instead the perfect source of nutrients or fertilizer.**

### Disease

Increasing the diversity of microorganisms in the soil will stop disease-causing organisms to gain dominance.

### Salt accumulation and soil compaction
On covered soil, acid rains will sink deep in the ground where microorganisms will act on the pollutants and purify the water.

On modern agriculture, the operation of heavy vehicles compress the soil.
When the rain falls, water is trapped in this compacted soil layer. It does not flow down but rather stagnates at a short depth below the surface, slowly evaporating and leaving the salt behind.

When acid rain evaporates, it leaves behind pollutants and heavy metals in the soil.

**We have to get rid of the compacted soil layer.**

Unless you eliminate this layer, soil salinity will always be a problem and farming will be more difficult.

### Fertilization
In nature 3 rules govern fertilizers:

1. debris are fresh
2. fall on the soil surface
3. are applied in autumn

In traditional agriculture, when the fall came, farmers would scattered cow dung and other organic matter onto the fields which would break down throughout the winter and would have fertilized the soil by spring.

Modern farming suggests the opposite.

1. the fertilizers should be fully fermented
2. apply deep into the soil
3. in the spring

Since they say that fertilizer has to go deep, expensive machines are necessary.
