## Organic matter in the soil
Organic matter is important as the mineral content of Nitrogen (N), Potassium (K), Calcium (Ca), phosporus (P) etc.
If organic nutrients don't back up the soil, minerals will be dysfunctional.
96% of plant growth comes from organic nutrients (Carbon, Oxygen, Hydrogen..)
4% from inorganic nutrients (NPK etc)

1. Organic matter is broken down by small animals and microorganisms and transformed in humus.
2. Humus break down over time and releases nutrients into the soil thus making it fertile.
3. Couple with microbial activity, humus turns soil into an aggregate structure with good air permeability and water/fertilizer retaining properties.

Great quantity of humus = strong bond with nutrients (K,Ca,Mg,Fe,Zn) 
Even frequent rain cannot wash them away and the soil is resistant to erosion.

Liquid fertilizers do not have the advantage of humus because they have already turned into pure nutrients.

Organic matter in the soil generate an active microbial activity increasing the sugar content (Brix) producing top quality fruits.
