## Compost
Some say compost has to read 75*C in order to kill the harmful microbes and that beneficial bacterias will survive.

**All organic matter has, for billions of year, decomposed at ambient temperature.**

## Fertilizer
Nature apply fertilizer:
- in autumn
- on the surface
- in raw form

Another merit of autumn application is that prevent larvae damage in spring because there is no food. The organic mattes has decomposed completely through fall, winter and spring.

## What to use in the fertilizer
**Fertilizer need to be made from the whole plant not only the skin.** Fertilizers made from peels/skins don't posses the comprehensive nutrients required by plants.
