### Getting Leaf Mold


### Making leaf mold
If we don't have a forest nearby we can create our own leaf mold.
1. Find a clean, unpolluted space of soil
2. cover it with a thick layer of cut grass
3. apply water to keep it moist
4. wait for the soil beneath the grass to turn soft
5. use the soft soil as starter for microorganisms
