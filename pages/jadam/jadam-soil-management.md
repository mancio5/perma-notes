## Chemical accumulate in surface soil due to soil compaction
Tractors are the main culprit. The heavy wheels press down on the soil and their effect can be measured as deep as 7 meters.

Because of this compacted soil layer, the **agriculture chemicals cannot penetrate deep into the soil and enter breakdown cycle**.

When chemicals and antibiotics, contained in farmed animals manure, build up in the soil, they destroy the microorganisms. 

## Roots represents the soil condition
**The total area of the root extension** decides crop health.

If soil is compact you won't find any roots in soil deeper than 20cm.

## The visible (plant) represents what is invisibile (roots)
For a plant to produce an abundance of fruits, its nodes should be quite short with new shoots coming out continuously.

The roots should extend wide and deep for the plant to produce new shoots for fruiting.

HIGH YIELD comes from the total area of the root that comes in contact with plant food (fertilizer).
They only grow where they find food, so till the extend that is possible.

## Make your soil like leaf mold
- Microorganism composition in my field should be identical to that of the lead mold in the mountains.
- Organic matter is my field should be abundant like the leaf mold in the mountains
- Minerals in my field should be diverse like the leaf mold in the mountains 

## Microorganism dissolve contaminants and turn them into plant nutrients

## Sea water
For hundreds of year the leaching of nutrients from the soil have eventually gone in the sea. To cure it, we need to **bring back the nutrients from the sea**. 

83 elements have been found to be present in sea water, not only Mg, Ca, K and P but also other minerals.

Mixing microorganisms from leaf mold with sea water take all the diversity Earth has to offer: from the sea and the land.
