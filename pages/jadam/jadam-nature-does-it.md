## How nature does it
### Fertilization
In nature 3 rules govern fertilizers:

1. debris are fresh
2. fall on the soil surface
3. are applied in autumn

In traditional agriculture, when the fall came, farmers would scattered cow dung and other organic matter onto the fields which would break down throughout the winter and would have fertilized the soil by spring.
