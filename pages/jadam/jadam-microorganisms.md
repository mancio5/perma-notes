## The importance of microorganisms
On nature's soil, this solid organic substance is decomposed by microorganisms and transformed into liquid form.
Like nature, we want microorganisms to decompose organic material to produce fertilizers that provide nutrients for plants.

In nature, wherever a dead plant or animal falls, it decays on the spot without the extra input of human supplied microorganisms.

### Are there good and bad microorganisms?
Sadly, humans like to look to the world through the eyes of dualism. People prefer to draw a line between good and evil, not knowing that suck line does not exist beyond their concepts.

## Modern agriculture prefers to use microorganisms selectively
People think that organic farming is about putting the beneficial bacteria as much as possible into the soil.
Such "good" bacteria include yeast, lactobacillus, actinobacteria, hay bacillus and bacillus natty.

### 99% of soil microorganisms are unknown to us
Less than 1% of microorganisms can be cultured by technology used by modern science.

So even though companies might tout their product as being "good" bacteria, it can only represent a fraction of the total diversity available in nature.

### Disrupting the soil balance and nutrients
Selecting only few microorganisms means you are only providing a few types of nutrients to your plants. That inevitably means an imbalance of nutrients.
Selectively use good microbes and exclude the bad ones disrupts the balance of soil nutrition which can lead to increased diseases in crops.

**Use microorganisms selectively change the microorganism composition leading to change in nutrients. Microorganisms mean nutrients.**

## Find a balance
Instead of selecting we should look for a "balance".

1. Introduce a wide variety and abundance of microorganisms
2. Balance fertilizers

These are the base os "underground optimization".

## Where to get microorganisms

### Indigenous microorganisms
Microorganisms that are effective for the agriculture of a region can only come from that region.

**We don't need to buy microorganisms, we can take it from nature**

### Leaf mold contains all sort of microorganisms
*Leaf mold* is the best collection of all types of precious bacteria.
In the leaf mold exists particular strains that can decompose particular proteins, particular fats and other substances.

All sort of microorganisms including protozoa, algae, mold, fungi, bacteria and viruses exist in leaf mold.

### Selecting microorganisms
Because different microorganisms feed on different substance, if you need a specific type you just need to throw in the leaf mold the type of feed they prefer.
Microorganism that like that feed will multiply and take the dominance.

## Microorganisms cannot travel without the help of water
Their body is made up to 95% of water.
They cannot move around inside dry soil.
If you want microorganisms to reach your roots, water must reach it too.
