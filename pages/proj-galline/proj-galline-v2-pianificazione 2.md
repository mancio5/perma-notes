## Soil building plants
- confrey, nitrogen fixing plant, only plant with b12 
- stinging neetle

## Animals
Little mice, or other animals that you can't rid of. Capture and feed to the chicken.

## Midget bucket
Sustain a bucket in the air, drill 3/8 in. holes in the bottom.
Put the carcass of animal in there.
Flies will come into the holes and lay their eggs.
Midget will crawl out of the holes and chicken will wait them.

## Cover crop
When you finish with a bed or you need to remove the cover crop let the chickens in. Will eat the crop and till the ground.

## Weeds
Grass, Dandelion, stinging nettle etc. You cut it or let the chicken go and eat them.
20% of their diet can be on grass.

## Garden waste
All the brown leaves or what has been ruined by bugs. Left over crops.

## Potatoes
Boiled potatoes.

## Winter squash
They love flesh and seeds.

## Forage crops
Grow forage like:

- white clover
- buckwheat
- brown top millet
- bean corn
- sunflower
- amaranth
- alpha alpha, etc.

## Nuts
Crushed nuts found in the wild.

## Fruit trees
Excess fruits can go to the chickens.
You can run the chicken in the orchard after the fruits have fallen (doing this will sanitize the orchard from bugs).

## Garden pets
Find garden bugs knock them in a bucket of water (so they can't fly away) and feed to the chickens.

## Cibo Fermentato
If you need to feed them with grain why not ferment it? It will boost their immune system especially when they are chicks.

- put couple of days of food in a bucket
- cover with water
- leave it for a 3 days

it should smell sour not moldy

## Azolla
It reproduce by itself.

## Soldier flies
Biopod - portapod to get the larvas.
In their adult life (1 day) their only purpose is to mate and lay eggs. They will look for rotting vegetables to lay eggs. The larva will grow eating the vegetables and will try to crawl out of the bin.

## Sprout all grain
Increase the protein digestibility up to 30%.

## Food scraps & compost

## Eggs
If you have extra eggs, just crush them or cook them.

## Feathers
It's full of proteins. If they need it they will eat otherwise it will compost there.

## Use compost to feed chicken
