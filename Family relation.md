## Rooster
Chickens don't need a rooster to lay eggs but he:
- fertilize the eggs
- protect the flock
- complete the social structure

Precautions.
**Don't provoke/hit a rooster.** He's doing his job to protect the flock.
**Develop trust.** Get it when he's chick.

More then one rooster.
**If they fight and they are equally match.** Better to separate them.
**If they fight let them establish the peaking order.**

## Introducing chicks
Normally is not a problem, they might get some peaking but they will soon jump in their peaking order.
