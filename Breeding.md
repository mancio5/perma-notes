# Breeding

## Selecting breeding
Get the best male and females together.

### How to select them
**Males**
- 16-18 weeks male selection
- has vigor or vitality (big, crowing, sing, tilling, foraging...)
- taking care of the female, they are into mating
- not too aggressive but with vigor
- meat production
- 

### Female
- 26 weeks female selection (point of lay, their first egg)
- as many as you possible can
- around 12-15 females per male
- has vigor or vitality (big, sing, tilling, foraging...)
- egg production
- big head = will grow in a big body
- abdominal capacity (bigger room more eggs) (big space btw the tip of the back of the teal bone the and the pubic bones)

## Separate into families
- select the best male and the best female and using a bracelet.
- select the second best
- put the best in a separate pen
- wait couple of months after the female has started laying eggs to prove herself as a good producer
- start hatching from February to June 
- hatch as many chicks is possible

## Start Hatching
### Collecting the eggs
- wait at least 10 days after separation
- get 8-12 eggs in max 4 days (use always the newest)
- see if you have a breeding hen
- if you have it put the eggs under her
- if not discard the eggs older than 4 days

### Set up the brooder
- separated from the other chickens
- deep bedding
- breeding box

- feed + water(they don't eat or drink much during this time)
- dark place

## Test the hen
- put fake eggs in the pen to see if one the hen is breedy 
- the hen that stays on the eggs at night when all the others are on the trespoli might be ready

## Put her in the brooder
- separate her at night when she can't see much
- put her in the breeding box with the fake eggs for 24h to check if she will stay on the eggs until the hatching
- if she tries to come out put the opening over a wall

- come back in after 6 hours to check if she is quiter
- if she is ready we replace the fake eggs with the fertilized one
