# Chicken Functions
## Nitrogen source
Each chicken can poop 8 pounds of manure a month.

## Tilling
## Garbage disposal
They will eat all the food scraps.

## Fertilize
1 chicken can fertilize 4.5m2 feet in a month.

## Turn the compost pile and spread
Leave the compost or the material that we want to spread in the area, chicken will do that for us. They won't spread completely but they will do 70% of the work.

## Insect control
Their first food choice are bugs. You can let them go in the garden looking for bugs. 
If they stay for too long they might start eating the produces.

## Sanitize the orchard
Don't keep the chicken there all time because the orchard doesn't need that much nitrogen but you can run them there in spring and autumn.
- spring: will eat insects and larvas
- fall: will eat all the bugs that are in the fallen fruits and break the pests cycle.
